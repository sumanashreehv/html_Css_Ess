        <h1>Learning of HTML</h1>
        <p>
            This is my first lesson regarding HTML. I liked the class as I found it easy to understand and implement.
            If the tags are familar, then it becomes easy. To get familar with tags practise is the only option.
            I am currently taking essentials classes and it is just begining. Still long way to go to become front end developer.
            Great start!!!

            HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. 
            It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Hypertext means that the document contains 
            links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document 
            altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5. A Markup Language is a way that computers 
            speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses 
            two things: tags and attributes.

            Adding text to our HTML page is simple using an element opened with the tag "p" which creates a new paragraph. 
            We place all of our regular text inside the element "p". When we write text in HTML, we also have a number of 
            other elements we can use to control the text or make it appear in a certain way.
